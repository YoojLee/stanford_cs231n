class TwoLayerNet(object):
    """
    A two-layer fully-connected neural network. The net has an input dimension of
    N, a hidden layer dimension of H, and performs classification over C classes.
    We train the network with a softmax loss function and L2 regularization on the
    weight matrices. The network uses a ReLU nonlinearity after the first fully
    connected layer.

    In other words, the network has the following architecture:

    input - fully connected layer - ReLU - fully connected layer - softmax

    The outputs of the second fully-connected layer are the scores for each class.
